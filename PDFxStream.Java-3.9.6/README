## Requirements

* PDFxStream.Java _requires_ Java v1.5, but we _strongly recommend_ v1.7 or
  higher
* PDFxStream.NET requires .NET 2.0 SP2 or higher

Note that when using the image extraction capabilities of PDFxStream
(PDFImageStream) on Java, decoding certain images requires using a Java 1.7
runtime or later; previous Java runtimes do not contain certain image data
decoding improvements that 1.7 and later provide.
